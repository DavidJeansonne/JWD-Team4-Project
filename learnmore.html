      We opened in 1971 with the goal of addressing the unique needs and cultures of our thriving community. Then, several Navy doctors joined with other local officers and a group of nearby “hippies” to create The Imperial Beach Peoples’ Free Clinic. In their flip flops and shorts, volunteer doctors and staff welcomed patients into a converted old school house. It took donated medical supplies to bind the wounds and prevent disease with vaccines.

  <!-- A section that describes Health information -->
 
<p> Physical fitness is not the sole basis of being healthy; being healthy means being mentally and emotionally fit. Being healthy should be part of your overall lifestyle. Living a healthy lifestyle can help prevent chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. Feeling good about yourself and taking care of your health are important for your self-esteem and self-image. Maintain a healthy lifestyle by doing what is right for your body.</p>

<p> Good nutrition is often the first line of defense to avoid many diseases, including peripheral neuropathy. The best way to prevent peripheral neuropathy is to carefully manage any medical condition that puts you at risk. That means controlling your blood sugar level if you have diabetes or talking to your doctor about safe and effective treatments if you think you may have a problem with alcohol. Whether or not you have a medical condition, eat a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein. Keep a food diary so you are aware of what you’re eating and to make sure you get all the nutrients you need each day to stay as healthy as possible.</p>
